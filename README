This module was initially written to make working with Ajax on Zencart much easier. 

We decided to release it to the wild in hope that people can make use of it, fork it, improve it, or report bugs and issues as well as features they want.
This specific branch (framework version) is to be used ONLY with our Plugin Framework For Zencart (ZePLUF) which can gotten from:
https://github.com/yellow1912/ZenCartPluginFramework

The document is next to nothing for now, but we will try to work on it, feel free to send us questions via our contact form at rubikintegration.com  

If you like our work, and you have a blog or a website please mention about us and give us a link back to http://rubikintegration.com

Make sure you place all the files/folders inside zencart-root/plugins/riCjLoader/I hope you are having a great time. Just as a reminder, I need a favor from you to:
1. zip your product images and put it some where on your server so i can download
2. send me the missing templates including:
the email templates
the design for the dropdown of "all categories"
as we talked before, on the product info page, on the left of the product title is the product model, and as you can see right now im displaying only the first 5 chars but im not sure if that's the way you want it. main_page=product_info&products_id=473

and you should also browse the demo site, and tell me if anything is missing, more than likely it's because you haven't send me the design yet

Regards
